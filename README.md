# advice

A simple web page for when you need some unsolicited advice.

I've used the [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) in this project, which gives out random pieces of advice. Found this API while exploring the [Public API Lists](https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists) (which has some cool and interesting APIs you'd want to use for your next project).

Integrating the API was just a call to `fetch()`. The hardest part was the CSS styling to make it look like a page from a notebook.
